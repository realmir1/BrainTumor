## üîç Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **Keras** for the **detection of brain tumors** from MRI images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model classifies MRI scans into two categories: **'No Tumor'** and **'Tumor Present'**. The high accuracy and efficiency of the model can assist medical professionals in early and accurate diagnosis.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Efficiently load and preprocess MRI images for model training.
- **Model Development**: Build a robust CNN model using Keras to classify MRI scans.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics and visualization.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Display sample predictions to demonstrate model efficacy.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

### Keras
**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of **TensorFlow**, **Theano**, or **CNTK**. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and ease of use, making it ideal for building and training deep learning models.

**Key Features of Keras:**
- **User-Friendly API**: Simplifies the creation of complex neural network architectures.
- **Modular**: Composed of configurable modules such as layers, optimizers, and activation functions.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable for custom components.
- **Backend Flexibility**: Supports multiple backends like TensorFlow, allowing scalability and performance optimization.

In this project, Keras is utilized to construct, compile, and train the CNN model for brain tumor detection.

### Other Libraries
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of data and results.
- **Scikit-learn**: Tools for model evaluation and data splitting.

## üíª Usage

### Data Preparation

The first step involves loading and preprocessing the MRI images. The images are converted to grayscale, resized to a uniform dimension, and normalized.

```python
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Define data directory and categories
data_dir = '/kaggle/input/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection'
categories = ['no', 'yes']
img_size = 128
data = []
labels = []

# Load and preprocess images
for category in categories:
    path = os.path.join(data_dir, category)
    class_num = categories.index(category)
    for img in os.listdir(path):
        try:
            img_array = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, img), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
            resized_array = cv2.resize(img_array, (img_size, img_size))
            data.append(resized_array)
            labels.append(class_num)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error:", e)

# Convert to numpy arrays and normalize
data = np.array(data).reshape(-1, img_size, img_size, 1) / 255.0
labels = np.array(labels)

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)

# One-hot encode labels
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=2)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=2)
```

### Model Architecture

A Sequential CNN model is built with convolutional, pooling, flattening, dense, and dropout layers.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

# Build the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_size, img_size, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Training the Model

Compile and train the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=1)
```

### Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

```python
# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1]
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on sample images and visualize the results.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Select sample images
sample_images = X_test[:4]
sample_labels = y_test[:4]
predictions = model.predict(sample_images)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for i in range(4):
    plt.subplot(1, 4, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(sample_images[i].reshape(img_size, img_size), cmap='gray')
    true_label = "Yes" if np.argmax(sample_labels[i]) == 1 else "No"
    predicted_label = "Yes" if np.argmax(predictions[i]) == 1 else "No"
    plt.title(f"True: {true_label}\nPred: {predicted_label}")
    plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
